## Project Motivation

This project has 2 main goals. The first one is to get some insigths from the Airbnb Madrid dataset. To do this, I have applied the CRISP-DM method.

The dataset is full of information about the accommodates avaible in Airbnb in the city of Madrid. With all this information we are going to ask ourself a few questions:

Q1.- Is the quantity of accommodation offer equal all arround Madrid? <br>
Q2.- If a neighbourhood group has a lot of accommodations, does it mean that each of it's indiviual neighbourhood has it too? <br>
Q3.- Are the prices equal all over Madrid <br>
Q4.- How are the prices and availability rate in Madrid over the months <br>

Q5.- Finally, how well can we predict price based on the rest of the feautures? For this task, I will fit a linear model that will estimate the price based on other features <br>

The second goal is to learn how to apply all the information and techniques I have learn so far to a real case.

## Results

This project has been structured using the CRISP-DM method. In the notebook file you will find easy to go throgth each step since everything is documented.
1.- Business Understanding
  In this part, I first took a look at the data provided by Airbnb. Everyone can find this dataset in the [Airbnb get-data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
  
  came up with few questions I would like to answer using the dataset. 




## File descriptions

Thre are only 2 main files, the first one, a jupyter notebook with all the project. Along this one, you will find a .py file, inside you will find some functions I created to be used in this project.
