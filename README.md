## Project Motivation

This project has 2 main goals. The first one is to get some insigths from the Airbnb Madrid dataset. To do this, I have applied the CRISP-DM method.

The dataset is full of information about the accommodates avaible in Airbnb in the city of Madrid. With all this information we are going to ask ourself a few questions:

1.- Is the quantity of accommodation offer equal all arround Madrid? <br>
2.- If a neighbourhood group has a lot of accommodations, does it mean that each of it's indiviual neighbourhood has it too? <br>
3.- Are the prices equal all over Madrid <br>
4.- How are the prices and availability rate in Madrid over the months <br>

5.- Finally, how well can we predict price based on the rest of the feautures? For this task, I will fit a linear model that will estimate the price based on other features <br>

The second goal is to learn how to apply all the information and techniques I have learn so far to a real case.
